Update base.css with color themes from the startup image 



I've updated base.css to include color palettes derived from the four characters in our startup image. These colors are now designated for use across our app's features as follows:
- Person 1 colors for the Task page
- Person 2 colors for the Commit feature
- Person 3 colors for the Contact section
- Person 4 colors for the Budget feature

I've also created button styles that match these color schemes. Please ensure consistency by using these colors and button styles in your future updates.
